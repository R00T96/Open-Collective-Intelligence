# Solar Tree
Grow a solar energy generator from a seed.

# How to use this document?
Run the altered DNA sequence through reader to build a virtual representation of the sequence. 
Update where necessary.
  > We need a tool that runs the sequence to build the molecular components that allows simulations such as root formation.
