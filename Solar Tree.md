# Solar Tree
Grow a solar energy generator from a seed.

# How to use this document?
Run the altered DNA sequence through reader to build a virtual representation of the sequence. 
Update where necessary.
  > We need a tool that runs the sequence to build the molecular components that allows simulations such as root formation.
  >   "Use Encoders and Generative learning mechanisms to build the software tool
  > The simulation should allow us to change features such as thickness of leaves, transparency of the cell walls
  >   Imagine encoding the sequence to build a SMD LED strip on the trunk of the tree.
  >   Being able to encode how to absorb and transform Lithium from the ground to build a battery inside the tree would be cool! 
Upload the sequence to a comapny that does DNA translation.
