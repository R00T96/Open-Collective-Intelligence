#### Basics

**The Machine**
 - An enclosure lined with an laser array
 - Unit Crystalizes the molecules in place by bonding with similar ones
 - Activated Laser must match the bonding frequency of the molecules.
 - Bonding different colours could be achieved through optical frequency modulation
- Uses an array of lasers
	- Lasers could be frequency tuneable through voltage modulation -> this can be controllable through system software.
> I'm thinking it could have an array of lasers arranged in a circular fashion. 
> It should look super cool mate. Otherwise what's the point? 
> For inspiration consider this Stargate. It allows you to travel between worlds through wormholes.

 **Canisters**
- Liquid canisters or Gas
  - opens up more **Business Opportunities**
    - creates **More Jobs**
      - More Happy People 
 -  Contains **RGB** molecule mix - Basic version
  - Each band activated by a specific **Microwave Frequency**
    - `Opacity Value -> Physical Render` 
	    - Heat it up, Light it up. -> think of Lightning
	    - Requires a molecule with frequency dependent tuneable transparency
 > Inspiration behind this concept is the camping gas bottle. `Plug the gas in -> 20mins goes -> Food goes to belly`.
 > If the gas could be compressed then they could be marketed with different capacities Which Opens up more opportunities. Optimal ppm should be calculated as well.
 > Think of industrial sized 3D printers. We'll be able to print much larger structures. eg. Efficient homes, Spaceships, Tools
 > Since it's compressed gas, there needs to be governing laws to very tightly control what can be put into the canister. Otherwise human nature will cause disaster. 
 > We'll also need an open global canister marketplace. Imagine being able to order a canister that allows you to print a metallic kinetic sculpture!

**The Software** 
 - Standard 3D CAD software capable of creating a widely used and understood .OBJ file
	 - .OBJ file supports colour. Protocol enhancements are needed to support multiple materials. 
   - New open-source Opportunities for developers
   - Improves community engagement
   - Improves security
   - Creates more business opportunities

> We should be able to Wi-Fi connect the printer and transfer the .OBJ file. Or insert a flash drive (or a card).
> Software reads and validates the model against the printer specification. Activates the microwave background. Gas heats up to support bonding. Laser array starts tagging the molecules which causes them to bond. In a matter of minutes, we should get the printed product. 
> We might even be able to print food, biological material etc with further research.
