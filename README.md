# Open Collective Intelligence

We all have good ideas that we can not action.  
We also have lots of people with resources that can action these ideas.   

This repository aims to openly connect both parties to facilitate new technological innovations.
Which in turn will raise our standards of living.

This is an open invitation for all noblemen to contribute with your knowledge.

# Why
Rain water is no longer safe to drink. Human made harmful chemicals and particles in rain water gets absorbed by the plants which then gets consumed by us. 
We are essentially poisoning ourselves everyday without even realizing it. Corporations driven by greed is the main reason. The constant need to cut costs to maximize profits is the driving force behind that greed. As such humans end up producing unsustainable, harmful chemichals and tools for our consumption. This vicious cycle continues. 

This repository of knowledge aims to remove the "Money" from innovation equation thereby creating a framework that is not driven by greed but sustainability. 
Think about for a second, do we really need weapons grade Uranium? I'm sure Uranium exist for a reason, Should that reason be to kill the planet with a button click?

Another example, 3D printers. 
There are neumerous organisations actively working on 3D printing tech right now all around the world. 
The minds that work on this tech is scattered and are isolated by NDAs around the world.

Main goal of this project is to bring the expert minds together to openly build next-gen tools for human consumption. for example Acedemic researchers, Independent researchers, Students, Tech Enthusiasts, Entreprenures, Hackers, Tinkerers, Artists, Curious minds and the general public. 

Vision is that everyone in the world should have a say in how the tools should be built. 

# Usage
> Technologies are open to everyone but please do not cause negative consequences.  

Repository contains unlicensed blueprints of sustainable high-tech tools created and updated by the people of the world for the people of the world.

Product designers are expected to use the blueprints to design and build the tool.  
Tools can then be priced reasonably for everyone to use 
driving further innovations to the blueprint
