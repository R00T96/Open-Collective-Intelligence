This is the planning document for a desktop 3d printer. 

Techology State: Available, In Market

- Liquid canister powered
  - Business Opportunities
    - More Jobs
      - More Happy People
      
 Canisters contain RGB molecule mix
  - Each band activated by a specific microwave frequency
    - Opacity Value to Physical world will require a molecule when crystalized is transparent to a degree. Tunable through wave frequency.
  - Crystalize the molecules in place by binding with other similar ones through an array of lasers placed in a circular manner.
    - Think of the Stargate!
 
Software 
 - Standard 3D CAD software capable of creating a widely used and understood .STL file
   - New open-source Opportunities for developers
   
Machine
 - An enclosure lined with an laser array
    - Laser must match the bonding frequency of the molecules.
      - bonding different colors could be achived through a different frequency
